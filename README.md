#Simplifies Entity Rest Responses

For now just an experiment to delve into the rest module. 

Simplifies repsonse data. Makes fields simple single values if set up like that via Drupal's field systems.
Retains arrays for multivalue fields. Also retains multiple field columns for fields that support it.

Probably would only ever be used were you simply want retrieve data not update.
